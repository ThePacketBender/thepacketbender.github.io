My name is Jonathon:

- List appealing character traits (pro-tip: s/character/personality/) describing self on good days while half-consciously projecting personal insecurities.
- Humble brag!
- More pretentious hogwash.
- Primus sucks.
- I wonder if those 30 year old dudes still wearing t-shirts that say "Tool" have realized that their warning labels are showing yet?
- Something sentimental that others can be expected to relate back to their own life experience.
- It's been 40 years, I wonder if those Depeche Mode dudes still just can't get enough or if they're over it now?
- Jonathon was like that. A real arsehole when it came to reading into things. He liked to wrap things up into neat little packages that implied the world.

So what else do you need to know? Stuff about my family, or where I'm from? None of that matters. Not once you cross the ocean and cut yourself loose, looking for something more beautiful, something more exciting and yes, I admit, something more dangerous. So after eighteen hours in the back of an airplane, three dumb movies, two plastic meals, six beers and absolutely no sleep, I finally touch down.

### my history

The only downer is, everyone's got the same idea. We all travel thousands of miles just to watch TV and check in to somewhere with all the comforts of home, and you gotta ask yourself, what is the point of that? I just feel like everyone tries to do something different, but you always wind up doing the same damn thing.

You hope, and you dream. But you never believe that something's gonna happen for you. Not like it does in the movies. And when it actually does, you want it to feel different, more visceral, more real. I was waiting for it to hit me, but it just wouldn't happen.

And me? I still believe in paradise. But now at least I know it's not some place you can look for. Because it's not where you go. It's how you feel for a moment in your life when you're a part of something.



RE: "Does this dude really just take quotes from awful movies out of context all of the time and think it will come off to anyone as more profound than '2000-and-late called they want their pretentious hogwash back?'"

Not just movie quotes! Also song lyrics that were terrible 20 years ago, references that nobody would have thought funny or insightful when the referent was relevent (if it ever was!) and (Comming Soon!) Buzzword Madlibs (I swear I never do that, I'm not even hip to the buzz, much less it's lingo)!

please don't show this to anybody, I'm not usually like this.
